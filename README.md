# autogreenscreenv1

Edit your video background using A.I. 

basic `pip install -r requirements.txt` for setup


then `python autogreenscreen.py` runs the main algorithm

Made around early 2021, released recently because I made a better faster v2. Releasing that soon as separate repo, will link when published. Main thing updated is the segmentation model. The non-segmentation model stuff is all otherwise good code. Produces background replacement similar in quality to zoom.
